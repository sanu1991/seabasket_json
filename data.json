      "desc": "The seafood should be cleaned properly before cooking. For doing so, first of all, you need to spread the body open and remove all of the entrails, locate the fishs anus and cut this out in a 'v' or notch shape. Some fish have a kidney by the backbone. Remove it by swaping it out with a spoon or your thumbnail. Rinse the cavity out with a good stream of water and wash the skin."
